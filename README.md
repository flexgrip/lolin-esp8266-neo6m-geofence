# lolin-esp8266-neo6m-geofence
The arduino version of my geofence project.

Just pushing up the arduino version of my sketch. This should fire off buzzers when inside the bounding box. Yes, I know its a cheap method of handling bounding boxes in arduino. I'm sure there's a better one. But this ain't 
micropython and I wanted it done quick :)
